                    <p>A double room in a hotel is a room designed to accommodate the needs of guests that wish to share a bed. There are a few differences between hotels and motels, but for most of them, a standard double room contains one king-size bed that can accommodate two or more people. A double room can be ideal for a couple or a family that does not wish to be separated. As a hotelier, you can market a double room as the ultimate selection for couples, friends, teams, or a family with kids.

However, I travelled on leisure and found myself in a cramped and congested place. The rooms are clean, well maintained. Room service is good, lobby is nice looking.</p>
